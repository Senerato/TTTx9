Version 0.1.6:

Changes:

- Changed the program to be more of a standalone model.
- Added more javadoc.
- Added the ExampleAI.
- Removed the View and Controller classes since they don't fit in the new
idea of a standalone model.
- Changed all uses of "subGame" in the project to "subgame".
- Fixed bug: - The dashes that should point out new moves do not work properly.
- Fixed bug: - If a subgame ends in a draw, and a player has to submit a move in that
subgame, a nullpointer will occur. There is no winner in the subgame, so
a move has to be performed in the subgame, which is illegal.
- Fixed bug: the game did not finish when it ended in a draw, resulting in a
nullpointer.

Known bugs:



Upcoming features:

- Better separate the model, view and controller.
- Implement correct behaviour when a subgame ends in a draw.
