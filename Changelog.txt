Version 0.1.5 -> 0.1.6:

Changes:

- Changed the program to be more of a standalone model.

Known bugs:

- The dashes that should point out new moves do not work properly.
- If a subgame ends in a draw, and a player has to submit a move in that
subgame, a nullpointer will occur. There is no winner in the subgame, so
a move has to be performed in the subgame, which is illegal.

Upcoming features:

- Better separate the model, view and controller.
- Implement correct behaviour when a subgame ends in a draw.
